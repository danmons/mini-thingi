## About

Mini consoles and computers are fun, there are loads of commercial ones out there that bring a quick-hit of nostalgia with a low overhead of technical complexity to new and experienced users alike.

But there's also loads of systems that have never, and likely will never get the "mini" treatment.  Either due to technical complexity, or publisher/IP difficuties.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could grab your favourite SBC (Single Board Computer), slap an image on it, and turn it into a mini replica of your favourite old computer, console or arcade machine?
